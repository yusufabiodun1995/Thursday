  <h1>Favourite Places</h1>
  <p>These are my favourite places so far</p>
  <h1>Dubai</h1>
  <p> <strong>Dubai</strong> is a city and emirate in the United Arab Emirates known for luxury shopping, ultramodern architecture and a lively nightlife scene. Burj Khalifa, an 830m-tall tower, dominates the skyscraper-filled skyline. At its foot lies Dubai Fountain, with jets and lights choreographed to music. On artificial islands just offshore is Atlantis, The Palm, a resort with water and marine-animal parks</p>
